    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p>Last updated: January 1, 2026</p>
    <p>Welcome to FuelTag. Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using our digital fleet management &
        service credit platform.</p>

    <p>FuelTag provides a platform for users to purchase service credits redeemable at participating energy and
        maintenance locations
        ("Service Points"). By using our service, you are purchasing a digital service ticket that can be redeemed at
        the authorized location.</p>

    <h2>2. Digital Service Credits</h2>
    <p>Service credits purchased on this platform are valid only at the authorized service points listed in the
        application. A transaction is considered complete once the payment is successful and a service ticket QR is
        generated.</p>

    <p>We collect your phone number and name solely for the purpose of managing fleet service credits and providing a
        personalized experience. This data is essential for verifying your identity at authorized service points.</p>
    <h2>3. Redemption</h2>
    <p>To redeem your service credit, you must present the generated QR code to the authorized attendant at the
        participating service point. The attendant will scan the code to verify the service ticket.</p>

    <h2>4. Refunds & Cancellations</h2>

    <h2>5. Refunds & Cancellations</h2>
    <p>For details on refunds and cancellations, please refer to our <a href="refunds.html">Refund Policy</a>.</p>

    <p>Your information is used to facilitate fleet transactions, maintain your service history, and improve our
        service.
        We do not sell your personal data to third parties.</p>

    <p>FuelTag is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider. We are not responsible for any damage to vehicles or
        property occurring at the service point. All energy
        quality and dispensing issues are the responsibility of the respective service point owner.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at support@fueltag.in.</p>
