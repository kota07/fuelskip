        service, you are purchasing a digital fuel pass that can be redeemed at the selected station.</p>

    <h2>2. Digital Fuel Bookings</h2>
    <p>Fuel bookings generated on this platform are valid only at the specific participating fuel stations listed in the

    <h2>3. Redemption</h2>
    <p>To redeem your fuel booking, you must present the generated QR code to the authorized attendant at the
        participating bunk. The attendant will scan the code to initiate the fuel dispensing process.</p>
