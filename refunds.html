    <h1>Refunds & Cancellations</h1>
    <p>Last updated: January 1, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <p>Fuel bookings can be cancelled and fully refunded as long as the generated QR code has NOT been scanned or used
        at the fuel station. Once a booking is marked as "REDEEMED" or "USED", it cannot be cancelled or refunded.</p>

    <h2>2. Refund Process</h2>
    <p>If a technical error occur during the dispensing process or if you choose to cancel an unused booking, a refund
        will be initiated. Refunds are processed back to the original payment method.</p>

    <h2>3. Refund Timeline</h2>
    <p>Once a refund is initiated, it typically takes 5-7 working days for the amount to reflect in your bank account,
        depending on your bank's processing time.</p>

    <h2>4. Digital Delivery</h2>
    <p>FuelSkip provides digital bookings only. No physical shipping is involved. Your digital fuel pass is delivered
        instantly within the app upon successful payment.</p>

    <h2>5. How to Request a Refund</h2>
    <p>For any refund-related queries, please contact our support team at support@fuelskip.com with your Booking ID.</p>
