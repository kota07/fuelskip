    <h2>1. Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <p>Vouchers can be cancelled before they are scanned/used at the fuel station. Once a voucher is marked as "USED" by
        the attendant, it cannot be cancelled.</p>

    <h2>2. Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>If a technical error occurs and the fuel is not dispensed but the payment is deducted, a full refund will be
        processed within 5-7 working days to the original payment method.</p>

    <h2>3. Shipping Policy</h2>
    <p>FuelSkip provides digital vouchers only. No physical shipping is involved. Vouchers are delivered instantly
        within the app upon successful payment.</p>

    <h2>4. How to Request a Refund</h2>
    <p>Please contact our support team at support@fuelskip.com with your Voucher ID to initiate a refund request.</p>
